#-----------------------------------
View(rfm)  # the data viewer, comparable to what you see in Excel or SPSS


# Getting to know our data piece-wise
#-----------------------------------
dim(rfm)   		# shows the shape of the dataframe as ROWS COLS
nrow(rfm)		# shows number of rows, i.e. observations
ncol(rfm) 		# shows number of columns, i.e. No. of variables
names(rfm) 		# shows names of the variables
head(rfm)  		# OR head(rfm_clean, 20), shows first six rows of the dataframe OR a number you specify
tail(rfm)  		# OR tail(rfm_clean, 20), shows first six rows of the dataframe OR a number you specify
str(rfm)   		# shows the dataset structure â€“ variable type and first values
summary(rfm$Age) 	# shows the variable summary statistics
unique(rfm$Class) 	# shows the distinct values of a variables

# Plotting a single, continuous variable

# You can learn where values are clustered, if there are outliers, or how the data distribution is shaped

# Plotting a single, categorical variable
#-----------------------------------

# Bar or pie charts help to illustrate how groups are distribute
# You can learn which groups are more or less prominent, if one outperfroms the others, or or if unreasonable data is included

# Bar chart
